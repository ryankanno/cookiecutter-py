# cookiecutter-py

Each time you start a new Python project, you shouldn't start from scratch.
Ideally, you'd start with a standard project structure and set of tools and
integrations to help facilitate writing quality Python code.

This opinionated Python [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
template is the tool that will help you do just that.
