Each time you start a new Python project, you shouldn't start from scratch.
Ideally, you'd start with a standard project structure and set of tools and
integrations to help facilitate writing quality Python code.

This modern Python [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
template is the tool that will help you do just that.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

```sh
uv add cookiecutter
# pip install cookiecutter
# pipenv install cookiecutter
```

**Optional**: Install [Cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft)

```sh
uv add cruft
# pip install cruft
# pipenv install cruft
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Cookiecutter

```sh
cookiecutter gh:ryankanno/cookiecutter-py
```

**Note**: If you want to use the auto approve / merge Dependabot workflow, make
sure to create tags `major`, `minor`, `patch` so that Dependabot can tag its
PRs. The workflow won't merge anything with a `major` tag.

### Cruft (Optional)

```sh
cruft create https://github.com/ryankanno/cookiecutter-py/
```

<!-- DETAILS -->
## üîç Details

Coming soon to a README near you!

### Docker

To build the container:

```sh
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build .
```

To run the container (if you've installed the defaults):

```sh
docker run <image_id or tag> python -m surf.surf
```

### Versioning

If you enable the PyPi workflow, versioning will happen via [`dunamai`](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai) within the Github pipeline.

If instead, you prefer to version your package, please do it via ```uv version $(dunamai from any)``` as recommended in their [documentation](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai#user-content-integration).
